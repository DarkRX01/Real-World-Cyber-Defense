## 📥 Download & run (easiest)

### Windows – portable (no install)

1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/DarkRX01/Real-World-Cyber-Defense/releases).
2. Download **`CyberDefense-Windows-Portable.zip`** (or the latest Windows build).
3. **Extract the whole ZIP** to a folder (e.g. `Desktop\CyberDefense`).
4. Double-click **`Run Cyber Defense.bat`** or **`CyberDefense.exe`**.

**First run:** The app starts in the tray (icon near the clock). **Double-click the tray icon** to open the window. See **README-FIRST.txt** in the folder for more.

> ⚠️ **Keep all files together** – Don’t move only the `.exe`. The app needs the other files in the same folder.

## 🛡️ How it helps you

Cyber Defense is built to be **actually useful** as an extra layer of protection:

- **Real-time file monitoring** – Watches Downloads, Desktop, Temp, and user dirs 24/7; scans new files instantly (hashes, YARA, PE heuristics). Ransomware honeypots in key dirs.
- **URL & clipboard** – Catches phishing and suspicious links before you open them.
- **Behavioral monitoring** – Flags suspicious process behavior and anomalous CPU spikes (e.g. mining/encryption).
- **YARA + PE heuristics** – Auto-updating YARA rules from GitHub; packed-EXE and entropy-based detection.
- **Quarantine** – Moves threats to a safe folder instead of deleting; you can restore or remove later.
- **Auto-updating blocklists** – Pulls YARA (GitHub), ClamAV, URLhaus, PhishTank so definitions stay current.
- **VPN** – Optional WireGuard connect/disconnect from tray; kill-switch alerts when VPN drops (local-only; no telemetry).

**Best setup:** Run Cyber Defense **together with** Windows Defender (or your main AV). Defender handles kernel-level and certified AV; Cyber Defense adds real-time file/URL/behavior monitoring and quarantine. See [PRODUCTION-IMPROVEMENTS.md](PRODUCTION-IMPROVEMENTS.md) for what’s under the hood and [SECURITY-ROADMAP.md](SECURITY-ROADMAP.md) for future kernel/driver options.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

| Issue | What to try |
|-------|-------------|
| App doesn’t start | Extract the **entire** ZIP; run **Run Cyber Defense.bat** or **CyberDefense.exe** from that folder. |
| SmartScreen warning | Click “More info” → “Run anyway”. |
| Antivirus blocks it | Common for unsigned apps. Add an exception for the app folder or build from source. |
| “Where’s the window?” | App starts in the tray. **Double-click the tray icon** to open the window. |
| Logs | `%APPDATA%\.cyber-defense\logs\` (Windows). |
