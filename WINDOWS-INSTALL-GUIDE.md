## ❓ Troubleshooting

### "Nothing happens when I click INSTALL-ME.bat"
→ Wait 30 seconds, it might be downloading Python in the background
→ Check if an "Installing..." window appeared briefly

### "I get an error about Python"
→ Make sure you have internet connection
→ Try downloading Python manually: https://www.python.org/downloads/
→ Then double-click INSTALL-ME.bat again

### "The app won't start"
→ Check system requirements: Windows 10 or newer
→ Make sure you have at least 512 MB of RAM free
