# ⚠️ WINDOWS SMARTSCREEN WARNING - What It Means

When you download CyberDefense.exe, you might see this message:

```
"Windows Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting"
```

## This Is Normal & Safe! ✅

**Why you see this:**
- CyberDefense is a new application (not signed by Microsoft)
- Windows shows this warning for ANY new unsigned EXE
- It's just a precaution, not an actual threat

**This happens with ALL open-source apps** - it's not unique to Cyber Defense.

## How To Run It (2 Clicks)

1. Click "More info" when you see the warning
2. Click "Run anyway"
3. Done! ✅

**That's all you need to do.**

## Why It's Safe

✅ **Open Source** - Source code visible on GitHub  
✅ **No Hidden Code** - You can review everything  
✅ **No Malware** - Built from clean Python code  
✅ **No Tracking** - No telemetry or data collection

## About The Warning

Windows shows SmartScreen warnings for:
- New applications (not yet known to Windows)
- Applications without a digital signature
- Any software from unknown publishers

**This is a safety feature, not a security issue.**

Popular applications you trust (before they were famous) showed the same warning.

2. Review what the app does: See `ARCHITECTURE.md`
3. Run from source code instead of EXE
4. Or use the ZIP installer

**You're in full control!** 🎯
